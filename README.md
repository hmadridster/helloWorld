firstRepo
// this is my first repo file. I am confused as to its structure.
If this is merely a readme file, why does it look like  file that goes into a project?
I know that readme content does not go into compiler.
How do I create other files and what filetypes are available?
How do i start a project? and where are the project files kept? 
where and how are the project files compiled?
I believe this is the edits file; it starts out as an exact copy of the master
But the branch will now becomposed of an edited file
